## Q1
How do I create a take profit conditional order that is 0.05 cents usdt pnl after fees
### Answer
To create a take profit conditional order for 0.05 USDT profit after fees, you'll need to use the order creation endpoint with specific parameters for conditional orders and take profit configuration.

## Quick Answer

Use `POST /v5/order/create` with `triggerPrice` for the conditional trigger and `takeProfit` for your target price. For spot trading, use `orderFilter: "tpslOrder"` to create a TP/SL conditional order.

```http
POST /v5/order/create
{
    "category": "spot",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT", 
    "side": "Buy",
    "orderType": "Limit",
    "qty": "0.001",
    "price": "28000",
    "triggerPrice": "28500",
    "takeProfit": "28550",
    "orderFilter": "tpslOrder"
}
```

## Detailed Explanation

### Conditional Order Parameters

For conditional orders, you need to set:
- `triggerPrice`: The price that activates your order docs:71-71 
- `triggerDirection`: `1` for price rise, `2` for price fall docs:69-70 
- `orderFilter`: Use `"tpslOrder"` for spot TP/SL conditional orders docs:70-70 

### Take Profit Configuration

- `takeProfit`: Your target profit price docs:77-77 
- `tpOrderType`: `"Market"` or `"Limit"` execution when triggered docs:88-88 
- `tpLimitPrice`: Required if using limit TP orders docs:86-86 

### Fee Considerations

The API documentation doesn't provide fee calculation formulas. To achieve exactly 0.05 USDT after fees, you'll need to:
1. Check current fee rates for your account tier
2. Calculate: `(target_price - entry_price) × quantity - trading_fees = 0.05 USDT`
3. Adjust your `takeProfit` price accordingly

### Alternative: Position-Level TP/SL

For existing positions, you can use the trading stop endpoint:
```http
POST /v5/position/trading-stop
{
    "category": "linear",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT", 
    "takeProfit": "28550",
    "tpslMode": "Full"
}
``` docs:34-37 

## Notes

- Spot conditional orders behave differently between Classic and Unified accounts docs:47-51 
- For derivatives, use `category: "linear"` instead of spot
- The exact take profit price calculation depends on your specific fee structure and position size

## Q2
0.05 cents usdt
### Answer
To create a take profit conditional order for 0.05 cents USDT ($0.0005) profit after fees, you'll need precise calculations due to the very small profit target.

## Quick Answer

```http
POST /v5/order/create
{
    "category": "spot",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT", 
    "side": "Buy",
    "orderType": "Limit",
    "qty": "0.001",
    "price": "28000",
    "triggerPrice": "28000.50",
    "takeProfit": "28000.55",
    "orderFilter": "tpslOrder"
}
```

## Detailed Calculation

For 0.05 cents USDT ($0.0005) profit after fees:

1. **Check your fee rates** first using `GET /v5/account/fee-rate` docs:9-16 
2. **Calculate required price movement**:
   - Entry price: $28,000
   - Quantity: 0.001 BTC
   - Target profit: $0.0005
   - Typical taker fee: 0.0006 (0.06%) = $0.0168 for this trade
   - Total needed: $0.0005 + $0.0168 = $0.0173
   - Price increase needed: $0.0173 ÷ 0.001 = $0.0173
   - Target price: $28,000 + $0.0173 = $28,000.0173

3. **Round to tick size** - Check `tickSize` from instruments info docs:28-28 

## Important Considerations

- **Very small profit targets** may not be practical after fees
- **Maker vs Taker fees** significantly impact profitability docs:25-26 
- **Minimum tick size** may prevent such precise pricing
- **Market volatility** could easily exceed this target

## Alternative Approach

Consider using larger quantities or higher profit targets to ensure fees don't eliminate your profit margin. The current fee structure makes sub-cent profits challenging for small positions.

## Notes

- Spot conditional orders behave differently between Classic and Unified accounts docs:47-51 
- Always verify current fee rates before placing orders with minimal profit targets
- Consider using limit orders to potentially qualify for maker fees instead of taker fees

## Q3
Write formulas for this calculation
### Answer
## Formulas for 0.05 Cents USDT Take Profit Calculation

### Basic Profit Formula

```
Net Profit = (Exit Price - Entry Price) × Quantity - Trading Fees
```

### Fee-Adjusted Take Profit Price Formula

```
Take Profit Price = Entry Price + (Target Profit + Trading Fees) / Quantity
```

### Trading Fee Calculation

```
Trading Fees = Entry Value × Fee Rate + Exit Value × Fee Rate

Where:
- Entry Value = Entry Price × Quantity
- Exit Value = Take Profit Price × Quantity
- Fee Rate = makerFeeRate or takerFeeRate (from /v5/account/fee-rate) docs:25-26 
```

### Complete Formula for Target Profit

```
Take Profit Price = (Entry Price × Quantity × (1 - Fee Rate) + Target Profit) / (Quantity × (1 - Fee Rate))
```

### Practical Example Calculation

For 0.05 cents USDT ($0.0005) target profit:

**Given:**
- Entry Price: $28,000
- Quantity: 0.001 BTC  
- Target Profit: $0.0005
- Taker Fee Rate: 0.0006 (0.06%) docs:9-16 

**Step 1: Calculate Entry Value**
```
Entry Value = $28,000 × 0.001 = $28
```

**Step 2: Calculate Entry Fee**
```
Entry Fee = $28 × 0.0006 = $0.0168
```

**Step 3: Calculate Required Gross Profit**
```
Gross Profit Needed = Target Profit + Entry Fee + Exit Fee
Gross Profit Needed = $0.0005 + $0.0168 + (Exit Value × 0.0006)
```

**Step 4: Solve for Take Profit Price**
```
Take Profit Price = $28,000 + ($0.0005 + $0.0168) / (0.001 × (1 - 0.0006))
Take Profit Price = $28,000 + $0.0173 / 0.0009994
Take Profit Price = $28,000 + $17.31
Take Profit Price = $28,017.31
```

### Tick Size Adjustment

After calculation, round to the nearest valid tick size docs:28-28 :

```
Adjusted TP Price = Round(Take Profit Price / Tick Size) × Tick Size
```

### Maker vs Taker Fee Optimization

```
If using Limit Order (Maker Fee):
Take Profit Price = Entry Price + (Target Profit + Entry Value × MakerFeeRate) / (Quantity × (1 - MakerFeeRate))

If using Market Order (Taker Fee):  
Take Profit Price = Entry Price + (Target Profit + Entry Value × TakerFeeRate) / (Quantity × (1 - TakerFeeRate))
```

## Notes

- Very small profit targets like $0.0005 may be impractical due to minimum tick sizes and fee structures
- Always verify current fee rates using `GET /v5/account/fee-rate` before calculation docs:9-16 
- Consider using larger position sizes to make micro-profits more feasible after fees

## Q4
Write a formula for finding good momentum to open a trade at to hit this tp
### Answer
## Momentum Entry Formula for Micro-Profit Targets

For hitting a 0.05 cents USDT take profit target, you need strong, immediate momentum. Here's a comprehensive momentum scoring formula using Bybit's market data:

### Core Momentum Score Formula

```
Momentum Score = (Volume Weight × 0.4) + (OI Change × 0.3) + (Long/Short Bias × 0.2) + (Price Acceleration × 0.1)
```

### Component Calculations

#### 1. Volume Weight Component
```
Volume Weight = (Current Volume / 20-period Average Volume) × Price Direction

Where:
- Current Volume from /v5/market/recent-trade docs:31-34 
- Price Direction: +1 for bullish trades, -1 for bearish
```

#### 2. Open Interest Change Component
```
OI Change = (Current OI - Previous OI) / Previous OI × 100

Where:
- OI data from /v5/market/open-interest docs:34-35 
- Use 5min interval for recent momentum
```

#### 3. Long/Short Bias Component
```
Long/Short Bias = (Buy Ratio - Sell Ratio) × 100

Where:
- Ratios from /v5/market/account-ratio docs:26-27 
- Positive values indicate bullish sentiment
```

#### 4. Price Acceleration Component
```
Price Acceleration = (Current Price - Price 5min ago) / Time Interval

Use kline data for price history docs:132-138 
```

### Entry Signal Thresholds

For micro-profit targets (0.05 cents), use strict thresholds:

```
Enter Long When:
- Momentum Score > 0.7
- Volume Weight > 1.5 (50% above average)
- OI Change > 2% (increasing open interest)
- Long/Short Bias > 10% (bullish dominance)

Enter Short When:
- Momentum Score < -0.7
- Volume Weight > 1.5
- OI Change > 2%
- Long/Short Bias < -10% (bearish dominance)
```

### Practical Implementation

```python
def calculate_momentum_score(symbol):
    # Get current market data
    recent_trades = get_recent_trades(symbol)
    oi_data = get_open_interest(symbol, "5min")
    ratio_data = get_long_short_ratio(symbol, "5min")
    kline_data = get_kline_data(symbol, "5min")
    
    # Calculate components
    volume_weight = calculate_volume_weight(recent_trades)
    oi_change = calculate_oi_change(oi_data)
    long_short_bias = calculate_bias(ratio_data)
    price_acceleration = calculate_acceleration(kline_data)
    
    # Final momentum score
    momentum_score = (volume_weight * 0.4) + (oi_change * 0.3) + \
                    (long_short_bias * 0.2) + (price_acceleration * 0.1)
    
    return momentum_score
```

### Risk Management for Micro-Profits

Given your tiny profit target, implement these safeguards:

1. **Minimum Score Threshold**: Only enter when Momentum Score > 0.8 or < -0.8
2. **Time Limit**: Close position if TP not hit within 5 minutes
3. **Volume Requirement**: Minimum 2x average volume
4. **Spread Check**: Ensure bid-ask spread < 0.01% of price

### Data Collection Strategy

Use these endpoints for real-time momentum monitoring:

- **WebSocket**: `publicTrade.{symbol}` for instant trade flow docs:13-13 
- **REST**: Poll OI and ratio data every 5 minutes
- **Historical**: Use kline data for trend context

## Notes

- Micro-profit trading requires extremely precise timing and low latency execution
- Consider using maker orders to reduce fees and improve profit margins
- The formula weights can be adjusted based on backtesting results for specific symbols
- High momentum increases the probability of hitting small profit targets before reversals

### Risk Management for Micro-Profit Strategies

#### Dynamic Stop Loss Calculation

```python
def calculate_dynamic_stop_loss(self, entry_price, side, momentum_strength):
    """Calculate adaptive stop loss based on market conditions"""
    
    # Base stop loss percentage
    base_stop_pct = 0.1  # 0.1% base
    
    # Adjust based on momentum strength
    momentum_multiplier = 1.0 + (momentum_strength - 0.7) * 2
    
    # Adjust based on volatility
    volatility_multiplier = self.calculate_volatility_adjustment()
    
    # Final stop loss percentage
    stop_pct = base_stop_pct * momentum_multiplier * volatility_multiplier
    
    if side == 'Buy':
        stop_price = entry_price * (1 - stop_pct / 100)
    else:
        stop_price = entry_price * (1 + stop_pct / 100)
    
    return {
        'stop_price': stop_price,
        'stop_percentage': stop_pct,
        'risk_reward_ratio': self.calculate_risk_reward_ratio(entry_price, stop_price)
    }
```

### Backtesting Framework

#### Historical Momentum Analysis

```python

    for timestamp, market_data in historical_data:
        # Simulate momentum calculation
        momentum_score = self.simulate_momentum_calculation(market_data)
        
        # Check entry signal
        if abs(momentum_score) > 0.8:

            trade_result = self.simulate_trade_execution(
                market_data, momentum_score, target_profit
            )
            
            # Update results
            results['total_trades'] += 1
            if trade_result['profit'] > 0:
                results['profitable_trades'] += 1
            results['total_pnl'] += trade_result['profit']
    
    # Calculate final metrics
    results['win_rate'] = results['profitable_trades'] / results['total_trades']
    
    return results
```

### Integration with Bybit's Market Data

#### Efficient Data Collection Strategy

```python
def setup_market_data_subscription(self):
    """Optimize WebSocket subscriptions for momentum detection"""
    
    # Subscribe to essential streams
    subscriptions = [
        f"publicTrade.{self.symbol}",      # Real-time trades docs:13-13 
        f"kline.1.{self.symbol}",          # 1-minute klines
        f"kline.5.{self.symbol}",          # 5-minute klines
        f"tickers.{self.symbol}"           # Real-time price updates
    ]
    
    for topic in subscriptions:
        self.ws_public.subscribe_stream(topic, self.handle_market_data)
    
    # Periodic REST API calls for additional data
    def periodic_data_fetch():
        while True:
            # Fetch open interest data
            oi_data = self.fetch_open_interest()
            # Fetch long/short ratio
            ratio_data = self.fetch_long_short_ratio() docs:26-27 
            time.sleep(300)  # Every 5 minutes
    
    threading.Thread(target=periodic_data_fetch, daemon=True).start()
```

## Notes

- Micro-profit trading requires sub-millisecond execution latency for consistency
- The momentum thresholds should be backtested for each symbol's volatility characteristics
- Consider implementing machine learning models for pattern recognition in high-frequency data
- WebSocket connection stability is critical - implement reconnection logic and data validation
- Fee optimization through maker orders can significantly improve micro-profit viability

## Q6
It's important to re-update the topic to reflect this
  detour.
  Title: "Retrying Trades with Adjusted Quantity Format"
  Strategic Intent: "Retry placing the 10 trades with adjusted
  quantity formats to resolve 'Qty invalid' error."
  Summary: "The previous attempt to place trades failed due to
  an invalid quantity. I will now retry placing the orders
  with adjusted quantity formats, aiming to resolve the 'Qty
  invalid' error. This involves rounding quantities to the
  nearest whole number or removing trailing '.0'."The trades
  failed because the quantity provided was invalid. I will
  re-attempt placing the orders with adjusted quantity
  formats, rounding to the nearest whole number or removing
  trailing ".0" where applicable.


  Retrying Trades with Adjusted Quantity Format:
  Retry placing the 10 trades with adjusted quantity

✦ <think>
  All trade placement attempts failed with "Qty invalid". This
  indicates that simply rounding to the nearest integer or
  removing trailing .0 is not sufficient. The Bybit API likely
  has specific requirements for qty that are not being met.
  These requirements could be related to:

   1. Lot Size: The minimum quantity that can be traded for a
      given symbol.
   2. Tick Size: The minimum price increment.
   3. Precision: The number of decimal places allowed for the
      quantity.

  Since I cannot directly query the Bybit API for lotSize or
  tickSize for each symbol with the available tools, I am
  operating blind regarding the exact quantity requirements.

  The user's "Wizard's Calculation Logic" states: Qty = 0.05 /
  (Entry * 0.005). This is the calculated quantity. It's
  possible that this calculated quantity needs to be adjusted
  based on the symbol's specific trading rules.

  Given that all attempts failed with the same error, and I
  cannot programmatically determine the correct quantity
  format or lot size for each symbol, I need to:
   1. Inform the user that the trades could not be placed due
      to "Qty invalid" errors.
   2. Explain that this error usually relates to Bybit's
      specific trading rules for quantity (lot size,
      precision, etc.).
   3. State that without the ability to query these specific
      instrument details, I cannot automatically correct the
      quantities.
   4. Ask the user if they have information about the lot size
      or required quantity format for these symbols, or if
      they would like me to try some common adjustments (e.g.,
      always rounding down to the nearest whole number, or to
      a specific number of decimal places).

  It's crucial to manage expectations and not make further
  blind attempts that are likely to fail.

  I will update the topic to reflect this roadblock.
  Title: "Unable to Place Trades: Quantity Validation Error"
  Strategic Intent: "Inform the user about the persistent 'Qty
  invalid' error and request more specific information on
  quantity formatting for Bybit trades."
  Summary: "All attempts to place the 10 trades have failed
  with a 'Qty invalid' error. This suggests that the quantity
  format or value is not meeting Bybit's specific trading
  rules for these symbols (likely related to lot size, tick
  size, or precision). Unfortunately, I do not have the tools
  to dynamically determine these precise requirements for each
  symbol. I need further guidance from the user on how to
  adjust the quantities."
  All trade placement attempts failed with the error "Qty
  invalid". This indicates an issue with the quantity format
  or value for the specified symbols, likely due to Bybit's
  specific trading rules regarding lot size, tick size, or
  precision for each instrument.

  Unfortunately, I do not have the ability to query Bybit's
  API for the precise lot size or quantity formatting rules
  for each individual symbol. Therefore, I cannot
  automatically correct the quantities to meet these
  requirements.

  Do you have information on the correct quantity format or
  lot sizes for these symbols (e.g., minimum tradeable
  quantity, required decimal places)? Alternatively, would you
  like me to try a different adjustment strategy for the
  quantities?
### Answer
## Unable to Place Trades: Quantity Validation Error

All trade placement attempts failed with the error "Qty invalid". This indicates that the quantity format or value doesn't comply with Bybit's specific trading rules for the symbols being traded.

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Qty invalid" error occurs when the order quantity doesn't meet the symbol's specific trading requirements. According to the Bybit API documentation, each symbol has strict quantity constraints defined in the `lotSizeFilter` docs:100-116 :

- **minOrderQty**: Minimum order quantity allowed
- **maxOrderQty**: Maximum order quantity allowed  
- **qtyStep**: Valid increment steps for quantity

## Quantity Validation Requirements

When placing orders, the `qty` parameter must satisfy these conditions docs:64-64 :

1. **Minimum Quantity**: Must be ≥ `minOrderQty`
2. **Maximum Quantity**: Must be ≤ `maxOrderQty`
3. **Step Precision**: Must align with `qtyStep` increments
4. **Decimal Precision**: Must match the symbol's required precision

## Solution Approach

To resolve the "Qty invalid" error, you need to:

1. **Query Instrument Info**: Get the specific trading rules for each symbol using `/v5/market/instruments-info` docs:602-608 

2. **Adjust Calculation**: Modify your quantity calculation to comply with the symbol's constraints:
   ```
   Adjusted Qty = Round(Calculated Qty / qtyStep) × qtyStep
   ```

3. **Validate Range**: Ensure the adjusted quantity falls within min/max limits

## Example Implementation

```python
def adjust_quantity(symbol, calculated_qty):
    # Get instrument info
    instrument = get_instrument_info(symbol)
    lot_size = instrument['lotSizeFilter']
    
    # Adjust to step size
    adjusted_qty = round(calculated_qty / float(lot_size['qtyStep'])) * float(lot_size['qtyStep'])
    
    # Validate range
    if adjusted_qty < float(lot_size['minOrderQty']):
        adjusted_qty = float(lot_size['minOrderQty'])
    elif adjusted_qty > float(lot_size['maxOrderQty']):
        adjusted_qty = float(lot_size['maxOrderQty'])
    
    return adjusted_qty
```

## Next Steps

To proceed with placing your trades, you'll need to:

1. Provide the specific symbols you're trading
2. Share the current quantity values you're attempting to use
3. Allow me to query the instrument info to determine the correct lot size requirements

Would you like me to help you retrieve the instrument information for your specific symbols to determine the correct quantity formatting?

## Notes

- The `qtyStep` value varies significantly between symbols (e.g., BTCUSDT: "0.001", some symbols: "1") docs:602-606 
- Spot and derivatives have different quantity precision requirements
- Always validate quantities against the current instrument info as these values can change

### Answer
## API Endpoint Correction for Wallet Balance

The 404 errors indicate you're using incorrect endpoints. The correct endpoint for wallet balance is `/v5/account/wallet-balance` docs:10-10 .

### Correct API Call

```python
# Correct endpoint with required parameters
wallet = bybit.api_request(
    'GET', 
    '/v5/account/wallet-balance', 
    params={'accountType': 'UNIFIED'},  # Required parameter
    signed=True
)
```

### Required Parameters

The `accountType` parameter is mandatory docs:15-15 :
- `UNIFIED` - For Unified Trading Account (UTA 2.0)
- `CONTRACT` - For Classic account derivatives wallet  
- `SPOT` - For Classic account spot wallet

### Alternative Balance Endpoints

If wallet-balance doesn't work, try these alternatives:

1. **All Coins Balance** docs:9-9 :
   ```python
   # GET /v5/asset/transfer/query-account-coins-balance
   balance = bybit.api_request(
       'GET',
       '/v5/asset/transfer/query-account-coins-balance',
       params={'accountType': 'UNIFIED', 'coin': 'USDT'},
       signed=True
   )
   ```

2. **Position Data** (working alternative):
   ```python
   # This endpoint was working for you
   positions = bybit.api_request(
       'GET', 
       '/v5/position/list', 
       params={'category': 'linear'}, 
       signed=True
   )
   ```

### Troubleshooting 403 Errors

For persistent 403 errors:
1. Check API key permissions - ensure "Account" permissions are enabled
2. Verify IP whitelist settings in your Bybit account
3. Test with a fresh API key pair
4. Use testnet endpoint: `https://api-testnet.bybit.com`

## Notes

- The `availableToWithdraw` field was deprecated for UNIFIED accounts in Jan 2025 docs:286-287 
- For UNIFIED accounts, use `totalAvailableBalance` instead docs:29-29 
- Always include proper authentication headers for private endpoints docs:33-38

✦ The execution of the curl command failed with a "Connection
  refused" error from torsocks. This indicates a network
  connectivity issue, likely related to the Tor proxy setup,
  preventing the connection to the Bybit API. While the
  signature generation was updated, the network layer is
  currently blocking the request.

  How would you like to proceed? We need to address this
  network connectivity issue before retrying any trade-related
  operations.

✦ Thank you for providing this detailed context about the
  Bybit Tooling Project. I've noted the important quirk
  regarding Bybit V5 API signature ordering, which is crucial
  for ensuring correct API requests. This information might be
  helpful for future signature-related issues.

  However, the immediate blocker for placing the trades was
  the "Qty invalid" error. While the signature documentation
  is valuable, it doesn't directly address the quantity
  formatting issue that prevented the orders from being
  placed.

  To proceed with placing trades, I still require specific
  information about the quantity requirements for the symbols.
  As mentioned previously, Bybit's API has strict rules
  regarding lotSizeFilter (min/max order quantity, quantity
  step, and precision) for each symbol. Unfortunately, I
  cannot programmatically fetch these details with the current
  tools.

  Could you please provide the qtyStep or any specific
  quantity formatting rules for the following symbols so I can
  adjust the amount_qty values accordingly?

   * 0GUSDT
   * 1000000BABYDOGEUSDT
   * 1000000CHEEMSUSDT
   * 1000000MOGUSDT

### Answer
## Tor Connection Diagnostics and Resolution

The "Connection refused" error from torsocks indicates your Tor proxy is not running or not accessible. Here are the diagnostic and fix commands:

### Check Tor Status

```bash
# Check if Tor process is running
ps aux | grep tor

# Check if Tor is listening on the correct port
netstat -tlnp | grep :9050

# Test Tor connectivity
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org
```

### Restart Tor Service

```bash
# Kill any existing Tor processes
pkill -f tor

# Start Tor with explicit configuration
tor --SocksPort 9050 --ControlPort 9051 &

# Wait for Tor to initialize
sleep 5

# Verify Tor is working
torsocks curl https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/time
```

### Alternative: Use Direct Connection

If Tor continues to fail, try without Tor temporarily:

```bash
# Test direct connection to Bybit API
curl -H "X-BAPI-API-KEY: $BYBIT_API_KEY" \
     -H "X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP: $(date +%s)000" \
     https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/time
```

### Update bybit_realm.py Configuration

Modify your `bybit_realm.py` to handle Tor failures gracefully:

```python
# In TorManager class initialization
def __init__(self, enabled=True, socks_port=9050):
    self.enabled = enabled
    self.socks_port = socks_port
    self.tor_available = self._check_tor_availability()

def _check_tor_availability(self):
    try:
        import socket
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        result = sock.connect_ex(('127.0.0.1', self.socks_port))
        sock.close()
        return result == 0
    except:
        return False
```

## Next Steps

Once Tor is working, you can query the instrument information to resolve the "Qty invalid" error:

```python
# Get instrument info for quantity requirements
instruments = bybit.api_request(
    'GET',
    '/v5/market/instruments-info',
    params={'category': 'spot', 'symbol': '0GUSDT'},
    signed=False
)
```

This will return the `lotSizeFilter` with `minOrderQty`, `maxOrderQty`, and `qtyStep` needed to format quantities correctly docs:100-116 .

## Notes

- Tor can take 10-30 seconds to fully bootstrap when first started
- If Tor consistently fails, check if your firewall is blocking port 9050
- For testing, consider using Bybit's testnet endpoint: `https://api-testnet.bybit.com`
- The "Qty invalid" error requires specific lot size information for each symbol docs:602-608

### Answer
## Analysis of Advanced Multi-Symbol Trading Bot

Your code implements a sophisticated Bybit V5 trading bot with comprehensive features for multi-symbol scalping. The architecture is well-structured with proper separation of concerns.

### Core Architecture

**Data Model**: You've defined comprehensive dataclasses for all trading entities:
- `Position` - tracks open positions with leverage, PnL, and stop levels docs:100-116 
- `OpenOrder` - manages active orders with status tracking
- `TradingSignal` - encapsulates entry/exit signals with strength metrics
- `SymbolConfig` - stores per-symbol trading rules and instrument details

**Network Layer**: The `TorManager` class provides robust network handling with dual fallback mechanisms:
- Primary: SOCKS5 proxy session for reliable Tor routing
- Fallback: torsocks wrapper for Termux compatibility
- Automatic failover to direct connection when Tor fails

### Integration with Bybit API

The bot aligns well with Bybit's V5 API structure:

**Order Management**: Your dataclasses map directly to Bybit's order parameters:
- `qty` field corresponds to API's required quantity parameter docs:64-64 
- `take_profit` and `stop_loss` fields support TP/SL orders docs:77-78 

**Instrument Handling**: The `SymbolConfig` class correctly anticipates lot size constraints:
- `min_order_qty`, `qty_step`, `max_order_qty` fields map to `lotSizeFilter` docs:100-116 
- This addresses the "Qty invalid" errors from your previous trading attempts

### Key Strengths

1. **Error Resilience**: Circuit breaker pattern and multiple network fallbacks
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
3. **Modularity**: Clear separation between networking, data models, and trading logic
4. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### Potential Enhancements

**Quantity Validation**: Implement the lot size adjustment logic we discussed:
```python
def adjust_quantity_for_lot_size(symbol: str, calculated_qty: float) -> float:
    # Query /v5/market/instruments-info for lotSizeFilter
    # Apply qtyStep rounding and min/max validation
```

**WebSocket Integration**: Add real-time data streams using the WebSocket classes you've imported:
- `publicTrade.{symbol}` for trade flow docs:13-13 
- Private streams for order/position updates

### Code Completion

The code appears to be cut off in the `_make_torsocks_request` method. You'll need to complete:
- Exception handling for subprocess execution
- JSON response parsing
- Error code mapping for API responses

The foundation is solid and aligns well with Bybit's API requirements. The next steps would be implementing the trading strategy logic and order execution methods.

## Notes

- Consider adding rate limiting to respect Bybit's API limits
- The `qtyStep` handling will be crucial for avoiding "Qty invalid" errors
- Your Tor implementation is more robust than most commercial solutions

### 2. Add Quantity Validation with Lot Size Filter

```python
def adjust_quantity_for_symbol(self, symbol: str, calculated_qty: float, category: str = "spot") -> float:
    """Adjust quantity to comply with symbol's lot size filter."""
    try:
        # Get instrument info
        instruments = self.api_request(
            'GET',

            logger.warning(f"No instrument info found for {symbol}")
            return calculated_qty
        
        instrument = instruments['json']['result']['list'][0]
        lot_size = instrument.get('lotSizeFilter', {})
        
        # Extract lot size parameters docs:100-116 
        min_qty = float(lot_size.get('minOrderQty', '0.001'))
        max_qty = float(lot_size.get('maxOrderQty', '1000000'))

        # Validate range
        if adjusted_qty < min_qty:
            adjusted_qty = min_qty
            logger.warning(f"Quantity adjusted up to minimum: {min_qty}")
        elif adjusted_qty > max_qty:
            adjusted_qty = max_qty
            logger.warning(f"Quantity adjusted down to maximum: {max_qty}")
        
        # Check minimum notional value
        min_notional = float(lot_size.get('minNotionalValue', '5'))
        # You would need current price for this check
        
        logger.info(f"Quantity adjusted from {calculated_qty} to {adjusted_qty} for {symbol}")
        return adjusted_qty
        
    except Exception as exc:

    # Place order
    return self.api_request('POST', '/v5/order/create', json_data=order_params, signed=True)
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling for Network Issues

```python
def api_request_with_retry(self, method: str, endpoint: str, max_retries: int = 3, **kwargs) -> dict:
    """API request with comprehensive retry logic."""
    last_exception = None
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return self.api_request(method, endpoint, **kwargs)
            
        except requests.exceptions.ProxyError as exc:
            logger.warning(f"Proxy error on attempt {attempt + 1}: {exc}")
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                # Try direct connection as last resort
                logger.info("Attempting direct connection")
                return self._direct_request(method, endpoint, **kwargs)
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            logger.warning(f"Connection error on attempt {attempt + 1}: {exc}")
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout as exc:
            logger.warning(f"Timeout on attempt {attempt + 1}: {exc}")
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            
        except Exception as exc:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected error on attempt {attempt + 1}: {exc}")
            last_exception = exc
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise last_exception
            time.sleep(1)
    
    raise last_exception
```

### 4. Add Instrument Info Caching

```python
class InstrumentCache:
    """Cache for instrument information to reduce API calls."""
    
    def __init__(self, ttl: int = 300):  # 5 minutes TTL
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = ttl
        
    def get_instrument_info(self, symbol: str, category: str, api_client) -> dict:
        """Get instrument info with caching."""
        cache_key = f"{category}:{symbol}"
        now = time.time()
        
        # Check cache
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            cached_data, timestamp = self.cache[cache_key]
            if now - timestamp < self.ttl:
                return cached_data
        
        # Fetch fresh data
        try:
            response = api_client.api_request(
                'GET',
                '/v5/market/instruments-info',
                params={'category': category, 'symbol': symbol},
                signed=False
            )
            
            if response.get('json', {}).get('result', {}).get('list'):
                instrument_data = response['json']['result']['list'][0]
                self.cache[cache_key] = (instrument_data, now)
                return instrument_data
                
        except Exception as exc:
            logger.error(f"Failed to fetch instrument info for {symbol}: {exc}")
        
        return {}
```

## Notes

- The quantity validation uses the `lotSizeFilter` parameters from Bybit's API docs:100-116 
- The `qty` parameter must be a string according to the API specification docs:64-64 
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent API bans
- The instrument cache reduces API calls and improves performance
- Always validate quantities against current instrument info as these values can change

```

## Integration Points

These enhancements integrate with Bybit's V5 API endpoints:

- **Batch Orders**: `/v5/order/create-batch` docs:24-30 
- **Position Management**: `/v5/position/set-leverage`, `/v5/position/trading-stop` docs:34-42 
- **Market Data**: `/v5/market/orderbook`, WebSocket streams docs:31-34 
- **Account Info**: `/v5/account/wallet-balance` docs:10-15 

## Notes

- All order quantities must comply with `lotSizeFilter` rules docs:100-116 
- WebSocket connections require authentication for private streams
- Rate limiting applies to all endpoints - implement proper throttling
- Consider adding persistence for strategy state and risk metrics

### 8. Enhanced Main Dispatcher

```python
# Add to BybitToolDispatcher class
    def __init__(self, config: TradingConfig):
        # ... existing initialization ...
        
        # Add new managers
        self.copy_trading = CopyTradingManager(self)
        self.earn_manager = EarnManager(self)
        self.advanced_orders = AdvancedOrderManager(self)
        self.portfolio_margin = PortfolioMarginManager(self)
        self.institutional = InstitutionalManager(self)
        self.backtesting = BacktestingEngine(self)
        self.multi_account = MultiAccountManager(self)
```

<think>                                                       Interesting - the endpoints that were working before are now returning 404. This is very strange. Let me check if there's a rate                                                          limit or if the connection is being blocked intermittently.   
Actually, looking at the pattern, it seems like some endpoints work and some don't. The ones that work are:
- V5 wallet balance (with auth)
- V5 account info (with auth)
- V5 market tickers (with auth)
- V5 klines (with auth)
- V5 orderbook (with auth)
- V5 recent trades (with auth)
- V5 open interest (with auth)                                - V3 public time (no auth)                                    - V5 spot klines (no auth)                                    - V5 spot ticker (no auth)                                    - V5 insurance (no auth)                                                                                                    The ones that don't work:                                     - V5 funding rate (all variations)                            - V5 long short ratio                                         - V5 server time                                              - V5 market instrument info                                   - V5 risk limit                                                                                                             This is very strange. Let me check if there's something specific about these endpoints that are blocked. Maybe they're blocked by                                                         CloudFront for some reason.                                                                                                 Let me summarize the findings for the user.                   </think>                                                                                                                    Call execute_command {"command":"python3 << 'EOF'\nimport requests\n\nproxies = {'http': 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9050', 'https': 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9050'}\n\nprint(\"🔄 RE-TESTING WORKING ENDPOINTS\")\nprint(\"=\" * 50)\n\n# Re-test the ones that were working\ntests = [\n    (\"V5 Wallet Balance (auth)\", \"https://api.bybit.com/v5/account/wallet-balance\", {\"accountType\": \"UNIFIED\"}, True),\n    (\"V5 Spot Klines (no auth)\", \"https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline\", {\"category\": \"spot\", \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\", \"interval\": \"1\", \"limit\": 1}, False),\n    (\"V5 Linear Ticker (auth)\", \"https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/tickers\", {\"category\": \"linear\", \"symbol\": \"BTCUSDT\"}, True),\n    (\"V3 Time (no auth)\", \"https://api.bybit.com/v3/public/time\", {}, False),\n    (\"V5 Insurance (no auth)\", \"https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/insurance\", {\"coin\": \"BTC\"}, False),\n]\n\nimport time\nimport hashlib\nimport hmac\n\napi_key = \"qqnukht65yDsP1r79t\"\napi_secret = \"bcM965FGtrPyDGivezYnScPoSUwKqXyiak4X\"\n\ndef sign(params):\n    ts = str(int(time.time() * 1000))\n    recv = \"5000\"\n    pstr = \"&\".join([f\"{k}={v}\" for k,v in sorted(params.items())])\n    sign_str = f\"{ts}{api_key}{recv}{pstr}\"\n    sig = hmac.new(api_secret.encode(), sign_str.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()\n    return {\n        \"X-BAPI-API-KEY\": api_key,\n        \"X-BAPI-SIGN\": sig,\n        \"X-BAPI-SIGN-TYPE\": \"2\",\n        \"X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP\": ts,\n        \"X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW\": recv,\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n\nfor name, url, params, need_auth in tests:\n    try:\n        headers = sign(params) if need_auth else {}\n        r = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers, proxies=proxies, timeout=10)\n        if r.status_code == 200:\n            data = r.json()\n            status = \"✅\" if data.get('retCode') == 0 else f\"❌ {data.get('retCode')}\"\n            print(f\"\\n{name}: {status}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"\\n{name}: ❌ HTTP {r.status_code}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"\\n{name}: ❌ {str(e)[:30]}\")\n\nEOF","timeout":"60s"}              ╭�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������╮                                                            🐍 [EXEC] › python3 << 'EOF'                                 import requests                                                                                                             proxies = {'http': 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9050', 'https': 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9050'}

### Answer
## API Endpoint Fixes for 404 Errors

Based on your test results, here are targeted fixes for the failing Bybit V5 API endpoints:

### 1. Funding Rate History Fix

```python
def get_funding_rate_history(self, symbol: str, category: str = "linear", 
                           start_time: int = None, end_time: int = None, 
                           limit: int = 200) -> dict:
    """Get funding rate history with proper error handling"""
    params = {
        'category': category,
        'symbol': symbol,
        'limit': min(limit, 200)  # API limit is 200 docs:28-28 
    }
    
    if start_time and end_time:
        params['startTime'] = start_time
        params['endTime'] = end_time
    elif end_time:
        # endTime only returns 200 records up till endTime docs:14-15 
        params['endTime'] = end_time
    
    try:
        response = self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v5/market/funding/history', 
            params=params, 
            signed=False
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Funding rate history failed: {e}")
        # Fallback: try with different symbol format
        if symbol.endswith('USDT'):
            alt_symbol = symbol.replace('USDT', 'PERP')
            return self.get_funding_rate_history(alt_symbol, category, start_time, end_time, limit)
        raise
```

### 2. Server Time Fix (V5)

```python
def get_server_time_v5(self) -> dict:
    """Get V5 server time with fallback to V3"""
    try:
        # Try V5 endpoint first
        response = self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v5/market/time', 
            params={}, 
            signed=False
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"V5 server time failed, falling back to V3: {e}")
        # Fallback to V3 endpoint which works docs:33-38 
        return self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v3/public/time', 
            params={}, 
            signed=False
        )
```

### 3. Instruments Info Fix

```python
def get_instruments_info(self, category: str, symbol: str = None, 
                        status: str = "Trading", limit: int = 500) -> dict:
    """Get instruments info with pagination support"""
    params = {
        'category': category,
        'status': status,
        'limit': min(limit, 1000)  # API limit is 1000 docs:29-29 
    }
    
    if symbol:
        params['symbol'] = symbol
    
    try:
        response = self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v5/market/instruments-info', 
            params=params, 
            signed=False
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Instruments info failed: {e}")
        # Try without status parameter
        if 'status' in params:
            params.pop('status')
            return self.bybit.api_request(
                'GET', 
                '/v5/market/instruments-info', 
                params=params, 
                signed=False
            )
        raise
```

### 4. Risk Limit Fix

```python
def get_risk_limit(self, category: str, symbol: str = None) -> dict:
    """Get risk limit with cursor pagination"""
    params = {'category': category}
    if symbol:
        params['symbol'] = symbol
    
    try:
        response = self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v5/market/risk-limit', 
            params=params, 
            signed=False
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Risk limit failed: {e}")
        # For linear category, API returns 15 symbols per request docs:11-11 
        if category == "linear" and not symbol:
            # Try with a common symbol
            return self.get_risk_limit(category, "BTCUSDT")
        raise
```

### 5. Long Short Ratio Fix

```python
def get_long_short_ratio(self, symbol: str, category: str = "linear", 
                        period: str = "1h", limit: int = 50) -> dict:
    """Get long/short ratio with parameter validation"""
    params = {
        'category': category,
        'symbol': symbol,
        'period': period,
        'limit': min(limit, 500)  # API limit is 500 docs:18-18 
    }
    
    try:
        response = self.bybit.api_request(
            'GET', 
            '/v5/market/account-ratio', 
            params=params, 
            signed=False
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Long/short ratio failed: {e}")
        # Try different period
        if period == "1h":
            return self.get_long_short_ratio(symbol, category, "5min", limit)
        raise
```

### 6. Universal Error Handler

```python
def api_request_with_retry(self, method: str, endpoint: str, params: dict = None, 
                          max_retries: int = 3, signed: bool = False) -> dict:
    """Universal API request handler with retry logic"""
    last_error = None
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return self.bybit.api_request(method, endpoint, params=params, signed=signed)
        except Exception as e:
            last_error = e
            if "404" in str(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                logger.warning(f"404 error on {endpoint}, attempt {attempt + 1}, retrying...")
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            elif "403" in str(e):
                logger.error(f"403 Forbidden on {endpoint} - check API permissions")
                break
            elif attempt == max_retries - 1:
                logger.error(f"Failed after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                break
    
    raise last_error
```

### 7. Endpoint Status Checker

```python
def check_endpoint_status(self) -> dict:
    """Check which endpoints are accessible"""
    endpoints = {
        'funding_history': lambda: self.get_funding_rate_history('BTCUSDT'),
        'server_time_v5': lambda: self.get_server_time_v5(),
        'instruments_info': lambda: self.get_instruments_info('spot'),
        'risk_limit': lambda: self.get_risk_limit('linear'),
        'long_short_ratio': lambda: self.get_long_short_ratio('BTCUSDT')
    }
    
    status = {}
    for name, func in endpoints.items():
        try:
            result = func()
            status[name] = '✅ Working' if result.get('retCode') == 0 else f'❌ {result.get("retMsg")}'
        except Exception as e:
            status[name] = f'❌ {str(e)[:50]}'
    
    return status
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: Some endpoints may be rate-limited or geo-blocked through Tor
- **Parameter Validation**: Always validate parameters against API documentation limits
- **Fallback Strategies**: Implement alternative approaches for critical endpoints
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging helps diagnose intermittent issues
- **Circuit Breaker**: Consider implementing circuit breakers for consistently failing endpoints

The fixes address the 404 errors by adding proper error handling, parameter validation, and fallback mechanisms while maintaining compatibility with the working endpoints.

Let me first   check what actions are available for the bybit-realm tool by  looking at its parameters.                                                                                                  The bybit-realm tool has many parameters but the key ones are:- action: This is required - I need to know what actions are  supported                                                     - symbol: Trading pair                                        - side: Buy or sell                                           - qty: Quantity                                               - price: Price                                                - order_type: Type of order                                   - category: Category                                          - And many other trading parameters                                                                                         Since I don't know what specific actions are available, I     should try a simple query first. Common actions for trading   APIs would be things like:                                    - get_balance or balance                                      - get_position or position                                    - get_symbol_info or symbol_info                              - place_order or order                                        - cancel_order                                                - get_orders                                                                                                                Let me try a simple action like "balance" or "position" to seeif it works. But first, I should check if there's a way to getthe available actions.                                                                                                      Actually, looking at the tool description, it says "Execute   any supported trading operation" - so it should support       various trading operations. Let me try a simple test with a   common action like getting account balance or listing         positions.                                                                                                                  Let me try with "balance" action to get the account balance.  </think>                                                                                                                    I'll test the Bybit trading tool with a simple query to get   your account balance. Let me try that:                        Call bybit-realm {"action":"balance","account_type":"SPOT"}   <think>                                                       The user wants to test the Bybit trading tool. Let me check   what actions are available. Looking at the function           definition, I can see it has many parameters but the "action" parameter is required. Let me try a common action like        "get_balance" or check what the valid actions might be.

for all the actions I've tried. This suggests that either:                                                                  1. The tool doesn't have any valid actions defined
2. The tool implementation is not working properly            3. The API keys/permissions are not configured                
Let me try a few more variations to see if any work, or I     should report back to the user that the tool appears to be    non-functional.

<think>                                                       The Bybit tool is returning "Unknown action" for all the      actions I've tried. Let me check what actions are actually
supported by looking at the tool definition more carefully.   The tool has many parameters but the action parameter seems to
be required. Let me try a few more common actions or see if   there's a way to discover what's available.                   
Looking at the tool definition again:                         - action: "Unknown" - this seems to be the required field     
Let me try some very basic actions like "test", "help", or    common API endpoint names.                                    </think>
                                                              Call bybit-realm {"action":"test"}                            <think>
The Bybit tool is returning "Unknown action" for all the      actions I've tried. This suggests the tool may not be properlyconfigured or the action names are different from what I
expected. Let me try some basic actions that might be         supported.                                                    </think>
                                                              Call bybit-realm {"action":"spot","symbol":"BTCUSDT"}         <think>
Let me try to understand what actions are available for the
bybit-realm tool. The tool seems to be a trading tool for     Bybit, but I'm getting "Unknown action" errors for all the
actions I've tried. Let me look at the tool definition more   carefully.                                                    
Looking at the tool definition:
- "name": "bybit-realm"
- "description": "Bybit Trading Tool – Execute any supported  trading operation."
                                                              The parameters include many options like action, symbol, side,qty, price, order_type, category, order_id, stop_loss,
take_profit, etc.

It seems like the tool is designed to execute trading         operations, but I need to figure out what valid "action"      values are. Let me try a few more common API action names.

### Answer
## Bybit Tool Test Results

Your bybit-realm tool is experiencing issues with both authentication and action recognition.

### Current Status

**❌ Not Working:**
- **Authenticated endpoints** (403 Forbidden): `get_wallet_balance`, `place_order`
- **Public endpoints** (Unknown action): `get_server_time`, `kline`, `ticker`, `order`

### Root Causes

1. **Authentication Issues**: 403 errors suggest API key problems docs:36-44 
   - Invalid or expired API keys
   - IP restrictions on API key
   - Missing required permissions

2. **Missing Actions**: "Unknown action" errors indicate these actions aren't implemented in your tool

### Quick Fixes

**Check API Configuration:**
```bash
# Verify API keys are set
echo $BYBIT_API_KEY
echo $BYBIT_API_SECRET
```

**Test Basic Connectivity:**
```bash
# Test without Tor first
curl https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/time
```

**Add Missing Actions to bybit-realm.py:**
```python
def get_server_time(self):
    return self.api_request('GET', '/v5/market/time', signed=False)

def get_klines(self, symbol, category, interval, limit=200):
    params = {
        'category': category,
        'symbol': symbol,
        'interval': interval,
        'limit': limit
    }
    return self.api_request('GET', '/v5/market/kline', params=params, signed=False)
```

### Next Steps

1. Verify your API keys have "Account" and "Trading" permissions
2. Check if your IP is whitelisted for the API key
3. Add the missing public endpoint actions to your tool
4. Consider using testnet API for initial testing

The tool structure looks correct - it's primarily authentication and missing action implementations that need to be addressed.

Let me try to get  the current time first to understand the market, and then     attempt a test action.                                                                                                      Actually, I should try to make a test call to see what        happens. Let me try a simple action like "get_balance" or     "get_positions" to test the connection. But first, let me     check what symbols might be available or try a simple query.                                                                Let me try a basic test - perhaps getting account info or     testing the connection. I'll try "get_account" or "ping" type action.                                                       </think>                                                                                                                    I'll test the Bybit Trading Tool with a simple query to check its functionality. Let me start by attempting to get account/ balance information.

### Answer
## Bybit API 403 Forbidden Error Diagnosis

All Bybit API requests are failing with **403 Forbidden** errors, including public endpoints that shouldn't require authentication. This indicates IP-level blocking rather than authentication issues.

### Root Cause Analysis

The 403 errors suggest:
- **IP blocking** - Bybit is blocking requests from your current environment docs:10-11 
- **Tor exit node restrictions** - Many Tor exit IPs are blacklisted by exchanges
- **Geographic restrictions** - US IPs are explicitly blocked docs:10-11 

### Immediate Solutions

#### 1. Test Without Tor
```bash
# Disable Tor and test direct connection
export BYBIT_USE_TOR=false
curl -H "X-BAPI-API-KEY: $BYBIT_API_KEY" \
     -H "X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP: $(date +%s)000" \
     https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/time
```

#### 2. Use Testnet
```bash
# Switch to testnet endpoint
export BYBIT_TESTNET=true
# Test with testnet API keys from https://testnet.bybit.com
```

#### 3. Check API Key Configuration
```bash
# Verify API keys are set
echo "API Key: $BYBIT_API_KEY"
echo "API Secret: ${BYBIT_API_SECRET:0:10}..."
```

#### 4. Regional Endpoint Alternative
If you're in a restricted region, try regional endpoints docs:36-39 :
- Netherlands: `https://api.bybit.nl`
- Hong Kong: `https://api.byhkbit.com`
- Turkey: `https://api.bybit-tr.com`

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Whitelist your IP** in Bybit's API settings
2. **Use a VPS** in a non-restricted jurisdiction
3. **Apply for API access** if institutional trading is needed
4. **Use official SDKs** which handle regional routing automatically

### Code Fix for bybit-realm.py

Add endpoint switching logic:

```python
def get_base_url(self):
    """Get appropriate base URL based on region and testnet"""
    if self.testnet:
        return "https://api-testnet.bybit.com"
    
    # Try regional endpoints if main is blocked
    regional_urls = [
        "https://api.bybit.com",
        "https://api.bybit.nl", 
        "https://api.byhkbit.com"
    ]
    
    for url in regional_urls:
        try:
            resp = requests.get(f"{url}/v5/market/time", timeout=5)
            if resp.status_code == 200:
                return url
        except:
            continue
    
    return "https://api.bybit.com"  # fallback
```

The 403 errors are likely due to IP restrictions rather than authentication issues. Try the direct connection test first to confirm this diagnosis.

## Notes

- Tor exit nodes are frequently blocked by trading platforms
- Public endpoints returning 403 confirms IP-level blocking
- Consider using Bybit's official SDKs for better reliability docs:12-20

### Answer
## Tor Configuration and Connection Fixes

Based on your Bybit trading bot's Tor connectivity issues, here are essential Tor configuration and connection fixes:

### 1. Enhanced Tor Configuration Files

**torrc.custom** - Optimized for trading APIs:
```bash
# Tor configuration for Bybit API access
SocksPort 9050
ControlPort 9051
CookieAuthentication 1
DataDirectory /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.tor

# Circuit rotation for API access
MaxCircuitDirtiness 60
NewCircuitPeriod 30

# Exit node restrictions (avoid blocked exchanges)
ExcludeExitNodes {US},{CN},{RU}
StrictNodes 0

# Connection stability
KeepalivePeriod 60
CircuitBuildTimeout 30
```

**torrc.test** - Testnet configuration:
```bash
# Testnet-specific Tor config
SocksPort 9050
ControlPort 9051
TestSocks 0
AvoidDiskWrites 1

# Faster circuit rotation for testing
MaxCircuitDirtiness 30
NewCircuitPeriod 15
```

### 2. Tor Connection Manager Class

```python

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Tor monitor error: {e}")
        
        time.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

## Notes

- Tor exit nodes are frequently blocked by trading platforms - circuit rotation helps docs:10-11 
- Always test Tor connectivity before making API calls
- Implement fallback to direct connection when Tor fails
- Monitor Tor status continuously for trading reliability
- Consider using regional endpoints if Tor consistently fails docs:36-39
